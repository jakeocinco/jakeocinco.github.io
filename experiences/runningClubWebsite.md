 &emsp;&emsp;Since my freshman year, I have been a part of the University of Cincinnati Running Club. Currently we use a Weebly website for our recruiting and Slack and Google forms to communicate to group members, so this website was created with the goal in mind of creating a hub that the running club can use to disseminate information as well as become a portal for all club activities. I used the clubâ€™s old website as a reference attempted to do everything that that website did in a more straight forward and visually appealing way, while also allowing club leadership to update information from an admin page rather than updating the static text on the screen. Where I believe this project fell short is that I was unable to implement sign ups, it is something I could do in the future but decided against it for the time being as I did not want to force users to share their information with a site that may not be secure.
