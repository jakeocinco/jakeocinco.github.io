&emsp;&emsp;The Gateway to University Honors in a nut shell is exactly as it sounds, it is a broad opening into the chances and experiences that the University of Cincinnati Honors Program provides. The course begins with talking about being a Global Citizen Scholar, which is someone who views the world with an open view and is able to take and learn from all experiences that are thrown at them. It then transitions this knowledge into being able to understand why you do what you do and how you can build on it, or the “so what” and “now what”. These “so what’s” and “now what’s” are essential in the process of reflections, a point in looking back and deep thinking about something you’ve done or a topic at hand. Reflection is not only a skill of deep thinker, but a requirement for UHP students after each honors experience. The next lesson, which had a profound effect on me, was finding our strengths. While the strength test gave me strengths that I would have known before, I was able to reassure myself and be more confident in my strengths. In the future, the class is transitioning into a final project where each group gives a mock proposal of an honors experience.

<h2>Describe a complex problem you individually wish to address. Be clear about how you plan to engage at the UC, local, national or international level. Why is this an important problem to you?</h2>

&emsp;&emsp;One issue that is very pertinent to me is that of easily accessible to those that cannot afford it, especially those in third world areas. Internet access seems like a pretty futile thing, that is not a necessity to life but it is now so intertwined with everything we do that we are unable to live without it. This problem can be viewed at many levels and is actually being argued on a national level right now, but my focus is on that of an international level. Less than 25% of people in countries in both Africa and the Middle East do not have access to the internet. With the internet now being crucial for the transfer of news, medical information, and communication, it can be argued that Internet is becoming essential to all life and has even been deemed a human right by the United Nations.

&emsp;&emsp;It would be nearly impossible to start from scratch on a problem like this, as that would involve people having to get computers, and this area would most likely be impoverished. This problem could be tackled through an honors experience in a place that has started to try and make a change but has been halted by issues. Other UC students and I, along with our past experiences and some technical training, would be able to come in and face these problems head on, most likely being more trained than the first person to attempt the problem.

&emsp;&emsp;This problem is important to me as it is not something that is being preached by the masses. While it is definitely not as important as bringing peace, food, or water to people in need, it is still very important and often overlooked. I believe that everyone should be able to have access to the Internet, and I see that something needs to be started on a small scale before it can reach a broad level of attention.

<h2>Using the thematic areas as a lens for your growth and development, how do you see yourself stepping out of your comfort zone to learn more or contribute to solving this problem? Describe two opportunities that could help you prepare to address this problem. Define at least one goal for yourself related to a chosen thematic area for the upcoming year.</h2>

&emsp;&emsp;In order for a problem like this to get started, a great deal of research would have to be done not only in how to set up the needed servers and satellites, but on where would be a good spot for implementation of this. Broad scale research is something that I have never been truly been comfortable with, often scared of starting then becoming unable to do it and letting advisors down, but ambitious of doing. A good research project for something like this could be learning how to build the equipment needed as well as trouble shoot as many issues as possible ahead of time, in order to create a problem guide for to help with future problems.

&emsp;&emsp;To help prepare for these problems I could do many things through the University. To help learn the technicalities of research, I could look for a COOP position through the University where I helped conduct research as opposed to working a normal job. This would allow me to research but with the guiding hand of an experience profession as opposed to alone. To learn how to properly write a problem-solving guide that would be easy and understandable, I could take the Intermediate English class offered through the Honor’s Program. This class would be perfect as it’s students are generally publish works, which would give me an advantage when writing a long guide.

&emsp;&emsp;One goal for myself in the upcoming year is to take a Leadership Role. In high school, I often took leadership roles without even thinking about but here I hesitate. I feel as though I am again scared of trying to take the lead when older students are around. In order to better this I don’t have to be the president of any clubs or even lead any projects, but just speaking up when I have an idea or an opposition to show that I can be an influential force. If I am able to do this through the next year, I would surely be able to take these roles in the future and even lead the project I talked about above.

<h2>Consider how one or two of your strengths could show up in these opportunities. Describe how you might invest in further developing those strengths.</h2>

&emsp;&emsp;I believe that my strengths would be very helpful in making my Internet project happen. Most of my strengths had to do with my desire to solve problems and learn more, Ideation, Strategic, Learner, and Context. These four strengths would come up often in research as ideas are formed and linked together in order to create even more discoveries. I also believe that these strengths could be strengthened from the very same thing. The more that I would test on myself by solving taxing problems the better and more experienced I would get, making me stronger for the future.

<h2>How will you use any of the other specific lessons from this course to address this problem?</h2>

&emsp;&emsp;Other lessons from the Gateway class will play a substantial role in addressing this problem. Reflection will have to be used constantly, not just once the problem is solved. If reflection is used throughout, I can think deeper about my progress as opposed to using solely hard data to analyze progress. I also believe that resiliency will be very important as numerous road blocks will have to be overcome and if I let every one of them bring me down, I won’t finish. The lesson that will be the most important though was the one about following the UHP vision of becoming a global citizen scholar. When solving a problem like this, it won’t just help me or the people I would physically help, but the answers that are found could be used to solve problems around the world on a much larger scale.
