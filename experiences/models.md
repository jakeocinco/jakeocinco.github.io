 &emsp;&emsp;In the Models II CEAS research experience, we were given the broad instructions to create something using MATLAB. My group, who consisted of Evan Penrod, David Eppele, Ian Doemling, and myself, created a project, “Recreating the Wheel”, in an attempt to try and learn more about both MATLAB and machine learning. We used the concept of creating an wheel that is ideal for specific terrains in order to show our comprehension of the topic at hand. Models, which represented wheels, were created by using an Object Oriented programming view to create objects that all consistent properties. We also had to test our models which lead us to create a physics engine within MATLAB, a process that took a great deal of mathematicsand abstraction to complete. The physics engine, as well as the models, were produced using both basic algebra and trigonometry, something that resulted in a much bigger issue than expected. I have attached images of our presentation as well as added a link to all the code that was written for the project.
