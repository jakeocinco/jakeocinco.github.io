 &emsp;&emsp; &emsp;&emsp;Throughout the entire Fall semester of 2019, I had the pleasure of taking a class cotaught by professors Dr. Kathleen Lynch and Dr. Constantine Polychroniou. This class focused on both the ancient histories and current economies of Greece and Egypt, then focused on how the two interact. The class then cumulated in a trip that spent time in both Greece and Egypt, putting on classroom knowledge into action. This trip was an outstanding experience, and it started on December 12th, 2019 when we took off from CVG and hopped on a slew on planes that finally got us to Athens, Greece!


<u>Day 1.</u>  We landed about halfway through the day but that didn’t stop us from going out and seeing the sights. Dr. Lynch took us on a tour of the immediate area surrounding our hotel and we started seeing some sights almost right away.

<u>Day 2.</u> Our first full day! The weather was not the best, so we pivoted and visited almost all of the museums on our schedule this day. This was a great start to our trip as it allowed us to see some of the statues, pottery, and outfits that we had been learning about during the semester and even my entire schooling career.

<u>Day 3.</u> Finally getting to see the sights in their natural setting, started the morning visiting a 6th century monastery before getting a chance to climb to the top of the acropolis and see the Parthenon.

<u>Day 4.</u> In an early start, we got on the bus and drove out to Pylos, Greece. We were blessed by Dr. Jack Davis and Dr. Sharron Stocker who took us in with open arms and gave us tours of UC’s excavations at the Griffin Warrior Tomb and Palace of Nestor at Pylos. Not only were we the first UC undergraduate students to ever visit here, but we got to learn about the new Tholos tombs before they had even been released. We then followed it up with a great lunch, with some awesome views.

<u>Day 5.</u> We walked up to the Agora, where we saw some amazing temples and the birthplace of democracy before visiting the American School of Classical Studies. At the ACCS, our professor, Dr. Kathleen Lynch, was able to show us how she and other archeologists would do their work. We talked with archivists, chemists, and even got to play with ancient pottery! Finally, we visited the US Embassy where we met with a foreign policy advisor who talked about Greece’s economic status.

<u>Day 6.</u> Sadly, we had to leave Greece. I had my last of many gyros and we headed for the airport, but luckily the we made it to Egypt. Landing in Egypt was an experience in itself and we drove to our hotel with all of our luggage on top of our van!

<u>Day 7.</u> We spent the day at Future University in Egypt, UC’s new partner University. We had some talks on Egyptian history and economics, then got the chance to meet our new friends from FUE. Our night concluded with a river cruise on the Nile.

<u>Day 8.</u> The day started by heading to the Egyptian National Museum where we got the chance to some ancient tombs, but even more impressively we got to see the sarcophagus of King Tut and almost 10 real mummies. Next we got to head to the crown jewel of Egypt, we got the chance to see the pyramids from up close, even getting to climb into a smaller pyramid (which was terrifying) and riding a camel with the pyramids in the background.

<u>Day 9.</u> Our final day, we got one last chance to hang out with our FUE friends, where we saw the Egyptain citadel as well as some amazing mosques, churches, and synagogues. This was the longest day of our trip however because we had to start our trip home.

This trip was absolutely amazing, even though I got sick for an entire week after the fact I would never have traded this trip for everything. Thank you to everyone who made the trip what it was from the faculty, to our friends at FUE, but most importantly to my classmates at UC who were all amazing.
